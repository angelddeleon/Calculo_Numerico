# Gauss-Seidel y Traductor Num√©rico.

# This program Solve systems of linear equations by the method of Gauss Seidel and convert a number from a base to another from decimal to a Hexadecimal

# Run application. Execute this command in your terminal

python main.py

# Main.py have two Buttons

Traductor Numerico: This button will launch the Numeric Translator functionality.

Gauss Seidel: This button will launch the Gauss-Seidel Method functionality.

# Functions in FrontTrad.py

The application will display a window with input fields for the number to be translated, the number system to translate from, and the number system to translate to. Users can select the number systems from dropdown menus and enter the number to be translated. The application will then display the translated number in the input field for the translated number.

# Functions in FrontGauss.py

The application will display a window with input fields for the coefficients and constants of the system of linear equations. Users can enter the coefficients and constants in the input fields. The application will then display the solution to the system of linear equations.
